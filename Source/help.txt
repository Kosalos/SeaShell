Another chance to waste time.
First you define the cross section of the shell;
imagine designing the die for a pasta extruder.
Next you define the shape of the shell.
Finally you can alter various properties of the shell.

Pinch the viewing windows to control zoom,
Slide 1 finger to rotate,
2 fingers to translate,
Tap to stop rotation.

A.  Button controls

D.  Shell shape drawing area
    Slide your finger to draw the shape of shell.
    Varying the speed of your movement affects the width of the shell.

E.  Launch the Thickness Dialog. Here you specify the
    shell thickness point by point.
    Use your finger to draw the thickness profile on the drawing area.
    The "SM" button will smooth out the profile,
    while "Low", and "High" reset all the profile to one setting.

    "Stereo"

    Image is rendered twice, for 'cross-eyed' 3D viewing.
    With the iPad held two feet away, slightly cross your eyes so
    that there is a third image in the middle.
    Relax your gaze, and concentrate only on that middle image, which is in 3D.
